# edgereader
my eyes hurt when i read stuff. and microsoft edge's pdf reader is realy good on windows. too bad the linux version doesnt have it QwQ

open powershell
then change to the directory where u downloaded this.
then in the directory 
with requirements.txt run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if that doesnt work try
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then 
```
py edgereader.py
```
or 
```
python3 edgereader.py
```
or 
```
python edgereader.py
```

when you are done close out of the window
