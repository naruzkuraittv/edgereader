# edgereader.py
My eyes hurt when I read stuff, and Microsoft Edge's PDF reader is excellent on Windows. Too bad the Linux version doesn't have it QwQ




# setup

- Open powershell in the directory where u downloaded and extracted this.
- run this command to install dependenceis
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- If that doesn't work, try
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```




# How to start
in the same folder that u ran the installer command run
```
py edgereader.py
```
or 
```
python3 edgereader.py
```
or 
```
python edgereader.py
```


# how to use


copy stuff
then run ctrl + alt + shift + r 
It will take whatever is on your clipboard and create a pdf 

If you don't have Edge Reader enabled, you might need to use ctrl + shift + u to auto-read for the first time
I like it when the reading thing is on fast.
You can make it faster or slower by going to voice options on the top right and changing the slider or the speaker.

When you are done, close the Powershell window.
