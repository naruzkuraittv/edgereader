# edgereader
my eyes hurt when i read stuff. and microsoft edge's pdf reader is realy good on windows. too bad the linux version doesnt have it QwQ




# setup

- open powershell in the directory where u downloaded and extracted this.
- run this command to install dependenceis
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- if that doesnt work try
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```




# how to start
in the same folder that u ran the installer command run
```
py edgereader.py
```
or 
```
python3 edgereader.py
```
or 
```
python edgereader.py
```


# how to use


copy stuff
then run ctrl + alt + shift + r 
it will take whatever is on your clipboard create a pdf 

if you dont have edge reader enabled you might need to use ctrl + shift + u to auto read for the first time
i like it the reading thing to be on fast.
you can make it faster or slower by going to voice options on the top right and changing the slider or the speaker

when you are done close the powershell window
